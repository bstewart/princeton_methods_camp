This section contains information on important dates and other logistical concerns. These are still being finalized and subject to change.

**Important Dates:**

June 24th: Assignment 1 due

Late July / early August / late August: Assignment 2 due (3 subsections)

August 29 - September 2: In-person methods camp

**Ed Discussion:**

Our primary means of communication and your primary resource for answering questions will be through the Ed discussion board. Please post questions publicly whenever possible, but you can also post your questions privately for Joe and Angela to answer.

**Canvas:**

Assignments and additional resources will be posted to our Canvas site under "Modules". Reach out if you have not received an invite to the site.

**Gradescope:**

We will ask you to submit completed assignments to our Gradescope site. This will be the same platform used to turn in your assignments for SOC 500, so we hope this will familiarize you with the platform before the start of the school year.
