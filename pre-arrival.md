## Pre-arrival

#### Coding Assignment

In order to prepare you for the coding portion of the summer assignment and work we will be doing during the camp, we require you to complete the following [RStudio Primers](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers). These will be especially helpful if you have limited experience with R. Based on feedback from previous graduate students, practicing R coding is one of the best ways to prepare over the summer for the graduate statistics sequence.

- The Basics (all sub-modules)

- Work With Data (all sub-modules)

- Visualize Data - (Exploratory Data Analysis and Scatterplots sub-modules)

- Iterate  (complete Introduction to Iteration)

- Write Functions (complete Function Basics and How to Write a Function)

We have left open an option of an exemption from this part of the assignment. To request an exemption please email Angela and Varun an example of some code you have written, including the date of the code, purpose, and a 1-2 sentence explanation of what the code does.
