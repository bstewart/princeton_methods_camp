## Pre-arrival

Pre-arrival materials go here. We should include links to RStudio Primers and Khan Academy videos. We also need to send out assignments.

#### Reading Assignment

The textbook we will use for Methods Camp is *Essential Mathematics for Political and Social Research* by Jeff Gill. You are not expected to master the topics covered in the readings by the time you arrive at camp! These readings and the summer assignments are meant as a first introduction to what we'll be covering during the camp itself. If you find yourself struggling with a topic, reach out to us!

**Chapter 1: The Basics**

This chapter introduces you to some of the basic notation you will see used during camp and in classes. It also reviews the concepts of indexing, functions, polynomial functions, exponents, and logs. Reviewing the notation will be helpful to all students. If you are comfortable with the other concepts, this chapter shouldn’t take too much of your time.

**Chapter 3: Linear Algebra & Chapter 4: Linear Algebra Continued**

These chapters cover vector and matrix math.

Chapter 3 reviews math with vectors (addition, subtraction, different forms of multiplication), vector norms, types of matrices, math with matrices, and other matrix manipulation. The examples in this chapter are helpful for understanding the usefulness of certain concepts. Section 3.6: Advanced Topics, is challenging. Read it at least once, but don’t spend too much time on it.

Chapter 4 is about the theoretical and abstract properties of vectors and matrices. If you find these topics challenging, take your time and really read the material line by line. Don’t devote too much time to sections 4.5, 4.8, and 4.9, but make sure to take your  time with section 4.6: Matrix Inversion.

**Chapter 5: Elementary Scalar Calculus & Chapter 6: Additional Topics in Scalar and Vector Calculus**

These chapters cover calculus concepts.

Chapter 5 introduces basic calculus concepts. If you are comfortable with the concepts of limits, derivatives and rates of change, taking derivatives, L’Hospital’s Rule, Rolle’s Theorem and the Mean Value Theorem, definite and indefinite integrals, and finding indefinite integrals, you may be able to skim this chapter. However, understanding these basics will be important for your stats courses.

Chapter 6 covers partial derivatives, maxima and minima, root-finding, multi-dimensional integrals, finite and infinite series, and calculus with vectors and matrices. Sections 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, and 6.6 are particularly important. Sections 6.5, 6.7, and 6.8 may be more challenging.

**Chapter 7: Probability Theory**

This chapter covers probability theory, which will be a major focus of the early part of your fall statistics course. Pay special attention to sections 7.5, 7.6, 7.7, and 7.8. Overall this section might not be challenging, but I recommend taking your time with it. The more comfortable you are with probability theory, the better!

#### Coding Assignment

In order to prepare you for the coding portion of the summer assignment and work we will be doing during the camp, we are asking you to complete the following [RStudio Primers](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers).

- The Basics - compete all sub-modules.

- Work With data - complete all sub-modules.

- Visualize Data - complete Exploratory Data Analysis and Scatterplots sub-modules, browse others.

- Tidy Your Data - browse these; we will cover this material in the camp so it would be good to be familiar with it, but you won't need it for the summer assignment.

- Iterate - complete Introduction to Iteration.

- Write Functions - complete Function Basics and How to Write a Function, browse others.
