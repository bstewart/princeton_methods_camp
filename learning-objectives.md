The Methods Camp is designed to give you training in both math and computing.  In math, you will receive training in three main areas: calculus, probability, and matrix algebra.  In computing, you will receive training in three main areas: data wrangling, iteration, and visualization.

At the end of the Methods Camp, students will be able to:

- Start the semester excited and ready to learn new methods
- Explain in words and pictures what is a derivative, what is an integral, and how derivatives are useful for optimization.
- Define probabilities in sets, perform basic set operations, calculate conditional probabilities, and use Bayes rule.
- Perform matrix addition, subtraction, multiplication, and inversion.
- Combine the 5 dplyr verbs, join data sets, and convert between long and wide formats
- Use loops, purrr, and functions to avoid repeating yourself
- Make simple graphs in ggplot2, write RMarkdown documents, and write basic equation in LaTeX
