## Camp

In-person camp details are still being finalized and are subject to change. In past years, there have been 4 days of camp during the week prior to the start of the fall semester. Typically, the schedule for the on-campus portion of camp has looked something like the following: 

#### Typical daily schedule 

Breakfast: 9:00 AM

Morning session, math: 9:30 - 11:30 AM

Lunch session / speaker covering qualitative methods / student panel: 12:00 - 1:30 PM

Afternoon session, programming: 2:00 - 4:00 PM

**Location:** 165 Wallace Hall

**Office hours**: 4:00 PM - 6:00 PM (*Note*: in the past, students have found it helpful to use office hours as a time to just work on the homework together in one place)

Assignments are due the next day of camp. There may be a minor final project to complete during the last day of camp.
