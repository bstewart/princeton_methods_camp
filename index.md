# Princeton Sociology Summer Methods Camp 2023

The Princeton Sociology Summer Methods Camp gives incoming Sociology PhD students a running start at the beginning of their PhD program. The computational and statistical training provides necessary foundation for statistics and methods classes. We understand that participants come into the program with different backgrounds and experiences, and the Summer Methods Camp will be helpful for everyone, regardless of background.

This 2024 Summer Methods Camp will take place on 4 days: Tuesday, August 20; Wednesday, August 21; Thursday, August 22; Friday, August 23. Camp will run from 9am to 4pm in 165 Wallace Hall. Christina Pao and Varun Satish are this year's graduate student instructors and Professor Brandon Stewart is the faculty advisor. 

We have made code and slides used in the 2023 methods camp available on the [Princeton Methods Camp GitHub page](https://github.com/bstewart/princeton_methods_camp/tree/master/download).
