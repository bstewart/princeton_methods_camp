# Princeton Sociology Summer Methods Camp 2022

The Princeton Sociology Summer Methods Camp gives incoming Sociology PhD students a running start at the beginning of their PhD program. The computational and statistical training provides necessary foundation for statistics and methods classes. We understand that participants come into the program with different backgrounds and experiences, and the Summer Methods Camp will be helpful for everyone, regardless of background.

This 2022 Summer Methods Camp will take place Monday, August 29 to Friday, September 2, 2022 from 9am to 4pm in 165 Wallace Hall. Joe Sageman and Angela Li are this year's graduate student instructors and Professor Brandon Stewart is the faculty advisor. There will be 2 summer assignments due over the summer before the in-person portion of Methods Camp.
