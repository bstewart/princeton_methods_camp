# Princeton Sociology Summer Methods Camp 2020

The Princeton Sociology Summer Methods Camp gives incoming Sociology PhD students a running start at the beginning of their PhD program. The computational and statistical training provides necessary foundation for statistics and methods classes. We understand that participants come into the program with different backgrounds and experiences, and the Summer Methods Camp will be helpful for everyone, regardless of background.

This 2020 Summer Methods Camp will take place in several parts due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Math lessons will begin virtually August 3rd. Coding lessons will be either virtual or in-person (TBD) and will take place August 24th-25th and 28th. Liv Mann and Joe Sageman are this year's graduate student instructors and Professor Brandon Stewart is faculty advisor.
