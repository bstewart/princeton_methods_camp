# Princeton Sociology Summer Methods Camp 2025

The Princeton Sociology Summer Methods Camp gives incoming Sociology PhD students a running start at the beginning of their PhD program. The computational training provides necessary foundation for statistics and methods classes. We understand that participants come into the program with different backgrounds and experiences, and the Summer Methods Camp will be helpful for everyone, regardless of background.

This 2025 Summer Methods Camp will take place on 3 days: Saturday, August 30th; Friday, September 5th; Saturday, September 6th. Camp will run from 9:15am to 3pm in 165 Wallace Hall. Christina Pao and Sofia Avila are this year's graduate student instructors and Professor Florencia Torche is the faculty advisor. 

We have made the assignments and slides we will use available on the [Princeton Methods Camp GitHub page](https://github.com/bstewart/princeton_methods_camp/tree/master/download).
