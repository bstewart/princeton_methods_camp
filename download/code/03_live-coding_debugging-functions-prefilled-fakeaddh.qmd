# Warm up: Searching For Help

With a partner, brainstorm 3 strategies you can take when you run across a task
in your homework that you're not sure how to complete, or requires something slightly
different from what you covered in class. How long would you spend
on each one?

1. Reference class notes and see if there is a command to use (10 min)
2. Ask a friend (20 min)
3. Send an email to an instructor (10 min)

How would you evaluate the help you get?

- Date of post
- Whether it's in base R or dplyr
- Source of help (StackOverflow, CRAN, university help sites are reliable)
- Whether or not it uses a different custom package
- If it works!

Other folks have thought about this question. Remember: searching efficiently 
is a learned skill, and takes practice! (This is true in terms of grad school/research
in general as well as coding.)

# Load Add Health data

Let's reload the AddHealth data from yesterday.

```{r wd, message=F, warning=F}
# Load any packages needed
library(tidyverse)

# Load data
addh <- read_csv("data/addhealthfake.csv")
```

The codebook from the survey is online [here](https://addhealth.cpc.unc.edu/documentation/codebook-explorer/#/variable_collection/1573).

# Debugging / Troubleshooting

Debugging is a large part of learning to code. When you start coding, you will probably encounter errors a lot. As you encounter these errors over and over again, you will form a mental model of how to fix them. 

Fix the following pieces of 
incorrect code! (Change eval = T so that the chunk runs)

```{r debug, eval=F}
# Fix the following pieces of incorrect code!
summary(adddh)

read.cvs("addhealthfkae.csv")

filter(addh, age = 20)

ggplot(addh, aes(x = age)) %>%
  geom_histogram()
```

### Your Turn

Try to knit this document with the following buggy code. It won't knit! 

```{r intentional-bad-knit, eval=F}
badvec <- c(1, 2, 3, 4,)
```

In your group, brainstorm: what strategies can we use to knit this document?

- Correct this bug
- "Comment out" this line with a # in the chunk
- Move the code outside of the chunk
- Set the chunk option to eval=F 

Debugging long strings of code is harder. You might need to go small step by step, 
building from little pieces (either by line, or by nested function), so you can detect the problem.

To debug the ggplot call below, run the first line (without the +). Then run the first and second lines.
Then run the first, second, and third lines. And so on until you've found the problem. 

**Question**: Which line is causing the problem? (Bonus: can you find the bug?)


```{r intentional-ggplot-bug, eval = F}
ggplot(as.data.frame(sample_means), aes(x = sample_means)) +
  geom_density() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(addh4$imp_love),
             col = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(addh$imp_love),
             col = "blue", lintype = "dashed") + # linetype not lintype
  theme_bw() 
```

To debug the nested functions below, run the inside function (gsub). Then run 
the next nested function (gsub and strsplit). Then all three nested functions.

Which function is throwing the error?

**strsplit** function is!

```{r intentional-strsplit-bug, eval = F}
mean(as.numeric(unlist(strsplit(gsub("years", "", "1-2 years"), -)))) # dash needs to be in quotations
```

**Bonus Question**: Can you rewrite this using the native R pipe, with the corrected bug? 

This is easier to debug because you can see each line of code and run it step by step!

```{r}
gsub("years", "", "1-2 years") |>
  strsplit("-") |>
  unlist() |>
  as.numeric() |>
  mean()
```


# Functions - Basics

We've worked with a number of functions, but we can also write our own. For 
example, we can write code to standardize data (also know as a "z-score" in some cases).

```{r standardize-fxn}
# write function
standardize <- function(x) {
  zscore <- (x - mean(x)) / sd(x)
  return(zscore)
}

# standardize vars
z_inc <- standardize(addh$income)
z_age <- standardize(addh$age)

# note: standardize doesn't work for character
# standardize(addh$id)
```

### Your Turn

Create a new column in the `scores_df` dataframe called "zscores" for the
standardized scores. Save it back to `scores_df`.

```{r scores}
# create sample test scores
scores_df <- data.frame(scores = sample(60:100, size = 400, replace = T))

scores_df <- mutate(scores_df, zscores = standardize(scores))
```

R has a built in function called `scale()` that does the same thing as our function - go ahead and
try it out! Add a new column called `zscores2` created by using the scale() function.

Does this new column look the same?

```{r}
scores_df <- mutate(scores_df, zscores2 = scale(scores))

head(scores_df)
```

### Your Turn - Bonus

We don't want our function to try to standardize data that is a character, so we include some logical checks and an error message. What will the following code produce if we run `standardize()` on a character vector?

```{r fxn-checks, eval=F}
# rewrite function with a check
standardize <- function(x) {
  
  if(is.character(x)) {
    print("This function requires a numeric vector")
  }
  
  else {
    zscore <- (x - mean(x)) / sd(x)
    return(zscore)
  }
  
}

# test it out!
standardize(addh$id)
```

# For loops review - sampling

In the next bit of code, we'll take a random sample with replacement from a 
numeric variable in our data. We'll then take the mean of the variable in the sample. 
Finally, we will repeat this process 1000 times. 

We'll first create a new dataframe with just respondents with "high income".

```{r subset-high-inc}
# get the 75th percentile of this group to define "high income"
inc75 <- quantile(addh$income)[4]

# make new binary variable for if respondent has high income
addh <- addh %>%
  # make this variable a factor!
  mutate(income_high = factor(ifelse(income > inc75, 1, 0),
                              levels = c(0, 1),
                              labels = c("not high", "high")))

# filter by high income
addh2 <- filter(addh, income_high == "high")
nrow(addh2)
```

Then, we'll sample once and take the mean of our sample.

```{r sample-one-iteration}
set.seed(2345) # makes it so the random number generator is consistent
samp <- sample(addh2$money, size = 1000, replace = TRUE)
samp_mean <- mean(samp)
```

Next, we'll stick our code into a (draft) for loop.

```{r for-loop-scratch}
for (i in 1:1000) {
  samp <- sample(addh2$money, size = 1000, replace = TRUE)
  samp_mean <- mean(samp)
}
```

Finally, we'll optimize our for loop and save the output.

```{r for-loop-final}
# getting there...
sample_means <- c()
for (i in 1:1000) {
  samp <- sample(addh2$money, size = 1000, replace = TRUE)
  samp_mean <- mean(samp)
  sample_means[i] <- samp_mean
}

head(sample_means)

# best practices!
sample_means <- numeric(length = 1000) # or, "rep(0, 1000)"
for (i in seq_along(sample_means)) {
  samp <- sample(addh2$money, size = 1000, replace = TRUE)
  samp_mean <- mean(samp)
  sample_means[i] <- samp_mean
}

mean(sample_means)
```

We can visualize the distribution of these new means!

```{r vis-for-loop}
# plot it!
ggplot(as.data.frame(sample_means), aes(x = sample_means)) +
  geom_density() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(addh2$money), # true mean of our original data
             col = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
  theme_bw() 
```


### Your Turn

Tweak the above for loop to have the following changes:

- sample size of 500 for each sample
- look at the `love` variable instead
- produce 5,000 total samples (and thus 5,000 means)

What's the mean of the distribution of means?

```{r for-loop-2}
sample_means <- numeric(length = 5000)
for (i in seq_along(sample_means)) {
  samp <- sample(addh2$love, size = 500, replace = TRUE)
  samp_mean <- mean(samp)
  sample_means[i] <- samp_mean
}

mean(sample_means)
```

Visualize the distribution of the sample means using similar code as above.

```{r vis-for-loop-2}
ggplot(as.data.frame(sample_means), aes(x = sample_means)) +
  geom_density() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(addh2$love),
             col = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
  theme_bw() 
```

Changing small things about the for loop every time we want to change the sample
size can be annoying, so today we will introduce writing functions and {purrr} package!

### Your Turn - Bonus

Add another vertical line on your graph for the average importance of love of the whole sample (not just high inc folks) for comparison.

```{r add-vert-line}
ggplot(as.data.frame(sample_means), aes(x = sample_means)) +
  geom_density() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(addh2$love),
             col = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(addh2$love),
             col = "blue", linetype = "dashed") +
  theme_bw() 
```

# Functions - Sampling

We can also adapt the above code for sampling into a function. To write a function, we want to think about what goes in and what comes out. 

We also want to think about code that repeats vs. code that changes.

Note: this next bit requires some abstraction, which is a skill that requires
practice! It will come with time.

```{r compare-sampling-code, eval=F}
# Code from above
sample_means <- numeric(length = 1000)
for (i in seq_along(sample_means)) {
  samp <- sample(addh4$imp_money, size = 1000, replace = TRUE)
  samp_mean <- mean(samp)
  sample_means[i] <- samp_mean
}

sample_means

# Code from Your Turn - slightly different
sample_means <- numeric(length = 5000)
for (i in seq_along(sample_means)) {
  samp <- sample(addh4$imp_love, size = 500, replace = TRUE)
  samp_mean <- mean(samp)
  sample_means[i] <- samp_mean
}

sample_means
```

### Your Turn

What are the three aspects of the function that we changed? Write them below.

1. 
2.
3. 

We can use this to abstract out our code. The things that changed can be the 
**arguments** or **inputs** to our function!

What do we want to **output** or **return** from our function? Brainstorm possible ideas with a partner.

1.
2.

We can set function **defaults** if we want, too. Are there any numbers that make sense to be the **defaults** here? 

```{r abstract-fxn}
# Abstract out
calc_sample_means <- function(data = addh$imp_love,
                              length = 1000,
                              size = 100
                              ) {
  sample_means <- numeric(length = length)
  for (i in seq_along(sample_means)) {
    samp <- sample(data, size = size, replace = TRUE)
    samp_mean <- mean(samp)
    sample_means[i] <- samp_mean
  }
  
  return(sample_means)
}
```

### Your Turn

Try running the new function we wrote with various arguments. An example is provided below.

```{r run-fxn, eval=F}
calc_sample_means(addh$age, 10, 225)

```

### Your Turn - Bonus

We can use **positional** or **named** arguments in a function. Will the following code run?
Why or why not? Which of these types of arguments do you think we're using?

```{r run-fxn2, eval=F}
calc_sample_means(size = 225, data = addh$imp_love, length = 1999)
calc_sample_means(addh$imp_love, size = 10, length = 60)
```

# Functions - Visualization

We can use a function to generate ggplot2 graphics for us automatically as well!

```{r vis-fxn}
# Abstract out - ggplot2!
vis_sample_means <- function(data = addh$imp_money,
                              length = 1000,
                              size = 100
                              ) {
  sample_means <- numeric(length = length)
  for (i in seq_along(sample_means)) {
    samp <- sample(data, size = size, replace = TRUE)
    samp_mean <- mean(samp)
    sample_means[i] <- samp_mean
  }
  
  # NEW PART
  p <- ggplot(as.data.frame(sample_means), aes(x = sample_means)) +
    geom_density() +
    geom_vline(xintercept = mean(data),
               col = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
    theme_bw() 
  
  return(p)
}
```

### Your Turn

Try running the new function we wrote with various arguments.

```{r run-vis-fxn}
vis_sample_means(addh$income, 20, 100)
```

### Your Turn - Bonus

Let's pretend the length and the data are fixed. What happens when you change the sample size?

```{r vis-fxn-fixed}
# Abstract out - ggplot2!
vis_sample_means2 <- function(size = 100) {
  
  sample_means <- numeric(length = 1000)
  for (i in seq_along(sample_means)) {
    samp <- sample(addh$money, size = size, replace = TRUE)
    samp_mean <- mean(samp)
    sample_means[i] <- samp_mean
  }
  
  p <- ggplot(as.data.frame(sample_means), aes(x = sample_means)) +
    geom_density() +
    geom_vline(xintercept = mean(addh$imp_money),
               col = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
    theme_bw() +
    # updating scales to make this visible
    xlim(0, 10) +
    ylim(0, 20)
  
  return(p)
}
```
Create a vector called `sizes` that has sizes 100, 1000, 5000, and 10000.
Then, call the `lapply()` function with the first argument as the new vector
you created and the second the name of the function.

What do you think `lapply()` is doing?

```{r vis-fxn-lapply}
sizes <- c(100, 1000, 5000, 10000)

lapply(sizes, vis_sample_means2)
```

# Odds and Ends

### Pivoting data

ggplot2 likes "long" data. So if you have "wide" data, you may need to pivot it.

Pivoting to wide:

```{r}
addh_wide <- addh %>%
  select(id, money, love, nocheating) %>%
  pivot_longer(-id, names_to = "variable", values_to = "rating") 
```

### Your Turn

Plot three density plots of addh_wide on the same graph, with the variable in different colors.

```{r}
ggplot(addh_wide, aes(x = rating, col = variable)) +
  geom_density() +
  theme_bw()
```


Pivoting back to long:

```{r}
addh_wide %>%
  pivot_wider(id, names_from = variable, values_from = rating) 
```

# Functional programming

Unlike Python, C, etc., which are known as "object-oriented programming languages",
R is a "functional programming" language. That means that the most natural way to
do things is actually to write functions and "apply" them to lists of objects.
We'll teach you a few basics here! Read more in [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/fp.html). 

### Lists and the apply functions

We've mostly talked about vectors and dataframes, but R has another data type called a list.
Anything can go into a list: vectors, numbers, or even dataframes. They also don't need to be the same type.
These can be very powerful for use with functions, particularly with `lapply` and the `map_*()` functions from the {purrr} package.

Lists can hold anything - unlike vectors, they can also combine different **types** of things.
You can even make lists of lists!

Let's start with making two lists:

```{r}
list1 <- list(c(1, 2, 3), c(8, 9, 10), c(15, 16, 17))
list2 <- list(1, c(8, 9, 10), data.frame(x = c(15, 16, 17)))
```

The two base R functions that are useful to know are lapply() (take a list and a function, and plug every
item from the list into the function, output as a list) and sapply() (similar, but
returns a vector).

Here's lapply with the mean() function:

```{r}
lapply(list1, mean)
```

And here's sapply:

```{r}
sapply(list1, mean)
```

### Your Turn

Try to create a list of numeric vectors and take the max of each vector with lapply or sapply.

```{r}

```

# Transitioning to purrr

While the `apply()` functions are useful (and you'll see them on help sites),
we recommend using the `purrr` package instead to more flexibly specify the type of 
output you want.

The syntax is `map(mylist, myfunction, functionoptions)` and can change depending
on the type of output you want. 

**Exercise**: Go to Help > Cheat Sheets and find the cheatsheet for purrr. 
What are the different objects that can be returned by the `map_*()` functions?

- double vector
- integer vector
- character vector
- dataframe, by row or by column (not mentioned) - map_dfr


Here's map with the mean() function:

```{r}
map(list1, mean)
```

And here's map_dbl:

```{r}
map_dbl(list1, mean)
```

### Your Turn

Try to create a list of numeric vectors and take the max of each vector with a map_*() function.
Try out different ones!

```{r}

```
